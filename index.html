<h1>AwesomeWeb</h1>
<p>Gone.</p>

<p>AwesomeWeb <a href="https://medium.com/awesome-websites/the-148-word-email-that-sold-out-100-spots-in-99-minutes-4828a6f93961" title="AwesomeWeb launch email">launched</a> in 2013 as a premium, hand-vetted freelance marketplace.</p>

<p>In a world where the big marketplaces were taking 30, 40, and 50%, we had no hidden fees, no percentage of project cuts. Just a small monthly subscription, charge your full rate, and work with your clients however you like.</p>

<p>Built by freelancers for freelancers. One project paid for your account for life.</p>

<p>It worked! For awhile. We had thousands of freelancers and clients with millions of dollars in confirmed projects.</p>

<p>After eight years of getting to meet and interact with some of the world's most talented people, AwesomeWeb ran its course and we shut down in 2021.</p>

<p>Thank you to everyone who partnered with us over the years.</p>

<p>Cheers,<br/>
Nick, Michael, Dainis, and Mike</p>
